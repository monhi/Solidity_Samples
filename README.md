# Solidity_Samples

To get familiar with Solodity language, I watched a lot of video programs and implement all sample codes in them.
But as those programs are a bit old and because of the upgrades that Solitidy faced, I have to update those programs to compile with new compilers.
I share them here for 2 purposes:
1. I keep them here to be available wherever I want to refer to them.
2. To be just a small source to be used by other Solidity programmers.
3.
