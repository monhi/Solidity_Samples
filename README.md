# Solidity_Samples

To get familiar with Solodity language, I watched a lot of video tutorials and implement all sample codes.

But as those programs are a bit old and because of the upgrades that Solitidy faced, I have to update those programs to compile with new compilers and share them here for 2 purposes:

1. I keep them here to be available wherever I want to refer and update.
2. To be a small resource to be used by other Solidity programmers.
